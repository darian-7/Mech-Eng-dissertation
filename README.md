# Project description

### Final year Mechanical Engineering dissertation

I investigated the effect of the human mandible jaw angle on the chewing efficiency of Medicated Chewing Gums as a main focus of my thesis. Within this project I produced a custom Design of Experiment using the Instron compression machine by a self-designed sensitivity analysis for test parameters and with information from past researchers. I also designed Instron machine adaptors on Siemens NX, which were then prototyped and manufactured in stainless steel and aluminum material. The adaptors mimick different angles of the human mandible jaw and I designed a replica of human molar teeth required for experiments within the project. A Texture Profile Analysis was conducted using the test results obtained from the 'Two-bite test'. Conclusively, the work within this thesis produced a reliable and repeatable Two-bite test method for Medicated Chewing Gums. Several mechanical and textural properties were determined to conclude that a higher mandible jaw angle is more efficient at chewing than a lower one.
